### 2. ER Diagram and Relational Schema

   - Name
   - PhoneNumber

2. **Service**
   - ServiceID (PK)
   - Name
   - Price

   - CustomerID (FK)
   - ServiceID (FK)

#### Relational Schema:

```sql
Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
)

Service (
    ServiceID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
)

Appointment (
    AppointmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID),
    ServiceID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Service(ServiceID),
    DateTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Scheduled'
)
```

### 3. Windows Form Design

#### Current Implementation:
The application uses a tab-based interface with two main sections:

1. **Book Appointment Tab**
   - Customer Name input
   - Phone Number input
   - Service selection dropdown
   - Date and Time picker
   - Book Appointment button

2. **View Appointments Tab**
   - ListView displaying all appointments
   - Columns: Customer Name, Phone, Service, Date & Time


### 4. Implementation Recommendations

1. **Data Persistence**
```csharp
// Add database context
public class SalonDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Service> Services { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Appointment> Appointments { get; set; }
}
```

2. **Input Validation**
```csharp
private bool ValidatePhoneNumber(string phone)
{
    return Regex.IsMatch(phone, @"^\d{10}$");
}

private bool ValidateAppointmentTime(DateTime dateTime)
{
    return dateTime > DateTime.Now && 
           !appointments.Any(a => a.DateTime == dateTime);
}
```

3. **Appointment Management**
```csharp
public void UpdateAppointment(int id, Appointment updatedAppointment)
{
    var appointment = appointments.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Id == id);
    if (appointment != null)
    {
        appointment.CustomerName = updatedAppointment.CustomerName;
        appointment.PhoneNumber = updatedAppointment.PhoneNumber;
        appointment.Service = updatedAppointment.Service;
        appointment.DateTime = updatedAppointment.DateTime;
        RefreshAppointmentList();
    }
}
```

### 5. Testing Strategy
